1. multiple commands inside [] seperate by space
2. multiple commands outside [] superate by semicolon
3. [] is only used after Control Structures and User-Definedommands

README:
I did the model controller parts regarding processing the command. But as said
I probably need the IFnodes etc to simply store the commands.
So you probably need to create a StringNode??
I implemented IF/IFELSE/REPEAT in Model. Gonna do TO and MAKE.
There's some errors currently. I basically assumed there's gonna be 
Node.getChildren, Node.getValue(), etc. You can check the errors to see
what I assumed for the Node class to have.
I didn't test the code/(also couldn't cuz the errors). So I'm gonna be doing that
and repush so currently just be prepared if there's BUG in it. 
But the methods are good to go.

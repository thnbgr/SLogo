1. multiple commands inside [] seperate by space
2. multiple commands outside [] superate by semicolon
3. [] is only used after Control Structures and User-Definedommands

README:
I did the model controller parts regarding processing the command. But as said
I probably need the IFnodes etc to simply store the commands.
So you probably need to create a StringNode??
I implemented IF/IFELSE/REPEAT in Model. Gonna do TO and MAKE.
There's some errors currently. I basically assumed there's gonna be 
Node.getChildren, Node.getValue(), etc. You can check the errors to see
what I assumed for the Node class to have.
I didn't test the code/(also couldn't cuz the errors). So I'm gonna be doing that
and repush so currently just be prepared if there's BUG in it. 
But the methods are good to go.
Also there's sth we both didn't pay attention to. Multiple commands are actually
reperated by " " not ";", see the coursepage example [ fd 50 rt 90 ].
This is REALLY annoying regarding spliting commands. Now my assumption is that 
multiple commands will only be seperated like this in [ ], and [ ] can only be 
used AFTER Control structures, etc, and not independently.
